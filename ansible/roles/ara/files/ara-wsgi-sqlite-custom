# A WSGI script to load the ARA web application against a variable database
# location requested over HTTP.
# Can be configured using environment variables (i.e, Apache SetEnv) with the
# following variables:
#
# ARA_WSGI_TMPDIR_MAX_AGE
#   This WSGI middleware creates temporary directories which should be
#   discarded on a regular basis to avoid them accumulating.
#   This is a duration, in seconds, before cleaning directories up.
#   Defaults to 3600.
# ARA_WSGI_LOG_ROOT
#   Absolute path on the filesystem that matches the DocumentRoot of your
#   webserver vhost.
#   Defaults to '/srv/static/logs'.
